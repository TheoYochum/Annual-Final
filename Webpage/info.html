        <p>This is a project created to model various aspects of the COVID 19 pandemic and it's affects on the United States, with some focus on New York State. It utilizes data taken from the CDC's COVID data tracker found <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker">here</a>. The project itself is made up of individual pages, most of which is written in HTML, and then combined with various different graphics and tools from the python language to create a more dynamic page with visualizations of data.
