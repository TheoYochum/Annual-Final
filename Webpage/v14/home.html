            <h1>Modeling the Current State and Development of the Pandemic</h1>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted an incredibly large shit in society, as well as creating an immense amount of data. This project aims to model some of that data from a few different perspectives to get a better view on the pandemic as a whole. It is using data from the American CDC and a good deal of code to transform that data into a clearer medium. You may have seen graphs before like the one below, however there is much more that can be shown by messing around with the actual data itself. This is what I have attempted to do in this project, use the actual raw data to demonstrate the various different perspectives of the COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>
