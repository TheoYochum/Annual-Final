            <h1>Analysis of Vaccinations</h1>
        </div>
        <p>While vaccines are generally more unified they can tell you interesting things about a state. Vaccines are generally bid for so while the Federal Government can make the deals for the majority of Vaccines, their distribution is on a state by state basis and would be delegated to states in a not fully equal manner. You can tell a good amount about how the system works and the state we are at right now by looking at various statistics in Vaccinations.</p>
        <h2>State by State Vaccinations</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="./Images/Vaccinations Total.png">
            <img src="./Images/Vaccinations Population.png">
        </div>
        <p>With total vaccinations you see a very similar trend to the cases as when looking at the total amount they generally will follow the most populous states and continue down from there. When Looking at the doses in terms of the population you will see a much more unified but still telling description. If you look at the y-axis many states actually have more than 1 vaccine per person as every individual requires 2 doses, aside from the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, meaning that for full saturation of the population you would need 200,000 per 100,000. You can also see that the states regarded as wealthier and more urban have more vaccines than those in rural regions as they generally do not have as much bargaining power. You can see this especially with the virgin islands as they do have a considerable amount of vaccines but less than most as they are largely insignificant to the Federal Government and have poor economies on their own.</p>
        <h2>Vaccination Trends</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="./Images/Vaccination Trends.png">
        </div>
        <p>The trend in total vaccinations also paints a quite interesting but worrying picture. You can see that generally for the first few months there was a stead increase but around mid-April the number of vaccinations began to decline. This is largely significant of the population that is willing and eager to become vaccinated slowly getting saturated and it becomes harder and harder to find people to vaccinate. Combined with the previous graphs this paints a worrying picture as we are only at around halfway to full vaccination and we need to be at around 70-85% in order to achieve some level of herd immunity. This is due to the distrust by a large portion of the general public who does not want to take the vaccine and means  that the mythical herd immunity may still, and potentially forever, be out of reach.</p>
        <h2>Dosage Statistics</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="./Images/Vaccination Dosage Comparison.png">
            <img src="./Images/Vaccination Type Comparison.png">
        </div>
        <p>The latter two graphs are also fairly interesting and convey some of the previously touched on ideas in a different light. The first one shows the percentage vaccination of the population and notes the difference between the fully vaccinated population and the partially vaccinated population. From this you can infer a few things, you can look at how far along the population is as all the partially vaccinated population will likely turn fully vaccinated. You can also infer the rate at which people are being vaccinated as usually there is a predictable 4 week duration between partial and full vaccination meaning that the longer the gap the faster the recent rate of vaccination has been. This allows you to tell that states like Hawaii are both vaccinating very quickly and will also reach a high level of vaccination, which for an island region like that, means high levels of herd immunity. Yet there are states like Louisiana, Idaho, Georgia, and Alabama, that are not getting vaccinated very quickly and are already at low numbers indicating a possible impossibility of herd immunity. The second graph is less interesting but does highlight some characteristics. For example, everyone I know has gotten the Pfizer shot yet it is not tremendously far ahead of the Moderna shot. One other point is that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is labeled as the Janssen vaccine in a number of places.</p>
