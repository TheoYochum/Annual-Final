            <h1>Analysis of Demographic Data</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Demographic data can tell you a number of things. This project shows the relative cases, deaths, and vaccinations of the population when looking at the age, ethnicity and sex. This allows you to make a number of analyses, and can paint some pictures of how the pandemic affected different groups of people. The method of displaying this has the standard makeup of the population in blue, and is overlaid in red by that groups makeup of the given topic. An important note is that if a red bar is larger than its corresponding blue bar it does not mean the entire group and more has had that apply to them, it means that a disproportionate size of the larger group is made up of that group of people.</p>
        <h2>Age Analyses</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="./Images/Age Cases.png">
            <img src="./Images/Age Deaths.png">
            <img src="./Images/Age Vaccination.png">
        </div>
        <p>When looking at the age groups you can really tell the variability in how the pandemic affected everyone. The cases are disproportionately distributed among people considered “middle aged”. This is the main group of people that goes to work and has large social functions in the world. You see a large lack of cases among children, a significant amount of which is likely due to the inseverity of their symptoms and the fact that they were tested much less regularly leading to very low numbers. Then you have older populations who, while they are also much less social, are much more visible in symptoms and likely to be tested very often. Then when looking at deaths you see a much more drastic disparity where the fatalities are almost entirely made up of the older populations despite them making up a much smaller amount of the population owing to the massive disparity in age-based mortality rates. When looking at vaccines you see a trend reflective of how the vaccine rollout functioned. Most regions started vaccinations with people 75 and up and then gradually lowered the limit. Now many areas are allowing teenagers to get vaccinated leading to a gradual evening of the scales.</p>
        <h2>Ethnicity Analyses</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="./Images/Ethnicity Cases.png">
            <img src="./Images/Ethnicity Deaths.png">
            <img src="./Images/Ethnicity Vaccination.png">
        </div>
        <p>Looking at it from an ethnic perspective you can tell the large disparity in roles around the country. A disproportionate number of cases are on the Hispanic/Latino population indicating that they occupied the jobs requiring putting themselves at risk for infection. The White population had less cases than they could have indicating that they had more of the jobs allowing them to work remotely and not put themselves at risk. Interestingly this trend is not as reflected in deaths and instead the burden appears to be more on the Black population indicating a possible lower quality of healthcare and trouble getting the help needed that could prevent some deaths. Vaccinations are also fairly uniform but indicate that less Black and Hispanic people are vaccinated than they should be indicating an issue with communication and accessibility.</p>
        <h2>Sex Analyses</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="./Images/Sex Cases.png">
            <img src="./Images/Sex Deaths.png">
            <img src="./Images/Sex Vaccination.png">
        </div>
        <p>The breakdown in terms of sex is not as revealing but does have some noticeable trends. It appears that while women were more likely to be infected, they were less likely to die of the disease. This is reflective of the statistic that women have on average stronger immune systems than men. It is surprising that there is a significantly discernable difference given that these populations would be expected to be treated very similarly.</p>
