            <h1>Analysis of Cases and Deaths</h1>
        </div>
        <p>One of the simplest metrics you can look at when analyzing the pandemic is how many people have been infected with it, as well as how many people have died due to it. You can look at it on a regional basis to understand various aspects of the spread, you can also look at it in relation to time and how as we have gone further and further into the pandemic the numbers have developed in new ways. This can help give perspective on how different people have experienced the pandemic as well as put your own perception of it into context.</p>
        <h2>Total Cases and Deaths</h2>
        <div>

            <img src="./Images/Deaths Total.png">
        </div>
        <p>These graphs show the unadjusted values when looking at the sheer number of people that have been infected or killed by the pandemic. This is good at displaying groups of people who were most significantly impacted by it and who represents the majority of the victims. You can see that the large outliers are generally attributed to the most objectively populous states. California, Texas, and Florida occupy the top 3 spots and are also respectively the 3 most populous states. You can also see the significance of New York City, it has its own representation in the data, as it then takes 4th place when looking at the death count, but is not as high on the cases. This demonstrates the idea that the death rate can be affected by a variety of factors and while some places may have more cases, they may also have a lower mortality rate. However, these graphs are missing an important piece of information available in the next set.</p>
        <h2>Population Controlled Cases and Deaths</h2>

            <img src="./Images/Deaths Population.png">
        </div>
        <p>When you control for population you begin to see it normalize and the data be more consistent however there are still notable outliers. When looking at cases, the Dakotas and Rhode Island are the most prominent, indicating the fact that less populated or more rural states are not immune. However, when then considering these states in terms of deaths they still have relatively high numbers but are exceeded by regions that are generally more urbanized or have lesser access to health care. You can also better see the success of a few states in isolating themselves, Alaska, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam, all have geographic isolation on their side and can attribute their very low death rates to that, although the trend is less noticeable in terms of cases it just meant they did not have an overwhelming outbreak. There are some of the continental states that also stand out, such as Vermont, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington, and Maine. This is likely due to the fact that they occupy the northern corners of the country and are going to be out of the way of a spreading pandemic. You can see that, in terms of deaths, the more central urban states got hit the hardest, with New York City and New Jersey having some of the highest per capita deaths while also being in very close proximity. This demonstrates the vastly different experiences of the people in the pandemic.</p>
